Machine Learning Gladiator

Affectionately calling this “machine learning gladiator,” but it’s not new. This is one of the fastest ways to build practical intuition around machine learning.

The goal is to take out-of-the-box models and apply them to different datasets. This project is awesome for 3 main reasons:

First, you’ll build intuition for model-to-problem fit. Which models are robust to missing data? Which models handle categorical features well? Yes, you can dig through textbooks to find the answers, but you’ll learn better by seeing it in action.

Second, this project will teach you the invaluable skill of prototyping models quickly. In the real world, it’s often difficult to know which model will perform best without simply trying them.

Finally, this exercise helps you master the workflow of model building. For example, you’ll get to practice…

Importing data
Cleaning data
Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets
Pre-processing
Transformations
Feature engineering
Because you’ll use out-of-the-box models, you’ll have the chance to focus on honing these critical steps.
